# Utopia Core Asset Guideline

Assets in Utopia (Core) have two types in general.
JSON Assets: Used to store almost anything text related.
Others: well, they are others. These are all refrenced by JSON Assets.

# JSON Assets

A given JSON Assets constists of ** at least ** one *.json file. Possiblely more due to localization requirements.

## Basic Naming Rules

**1. NO DOTS ALLOWED IN NAMING ASSETS**
**2. ASSETS CANNOT BE NAMED AS SOME PRESERVED KEYWORDS**

## Folder Structures (Flat Layout)

Base json assets and its companions are positioned like this.
```
ðŸ“¦ Some sort of category folders or root
â”œâ”€ asset_name.json
â”œâ”€ asset_name.locale_code.json
â”œâ”€ asset_name.another_locale_code.json
â”œâ”€ ...
â”œâ”€ another_asset_name.json
â”œâ”€ another_asset_name.locale_code.json
â”œâ”€ another_asset_name.another_locale_code.json
â””â”€ ...
```
Since all assets and localization jsons are all in same dir, this is called flat layout.
The asset's name (unique) is its basejson's basename. The asset's identifier is its basejson's relative path without the json extension.

## Folder Structures (Grouped Layout)

Base json assets and its companions are positioned like this.
```
ðŸ“¦ Some sort of category folders or root
â”œâ”€ <asset_name>
â”‚  â”œâ”€ .json
â”‚  â”œâ”€ locale_code.json
â”‚  â”œâ”€ another_local_code.json
â”‚  â””â”€ ...
â”œâ”€ <another_asset_name>
â”‚  â”œâ”€ .json
â”‚  â”œâ”€ <locale_code>.json
â”‚  â”œâ”€ <another_local_code>.json
â”‚  â””â”€ ...
â””â”€ ...
```
Since jsons for single asset are contained inside a single folder named as asset_name, this is called grouped layout.
The asset's name (unique) is its parent folers name. The asset's identifier is its folder's relative path.
